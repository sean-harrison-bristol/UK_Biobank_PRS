Generating polygenic risk scores in UK Biobank (University of Bristol)

This repository is for generating polygenic risk scores (PRS) in UK Biobank when using Blue Crystal at the university of Bristol. 

The code will likely not work elsewhere due to the intricacies of supercomputers, but by all means give it a go.

There is a help file for the function, and a beginner's guide to using UK Biobank genetic data too. 

Some files are necessary for the code to function completely: the 1000 genomes European subsample bed, bim and fam files (for clumping), and the 1000 genomes LD file (for proxies). I haven't found them online, and they are too big to post here. If you need them, let me know and I'll FTP them (they aren't sensitive files).
