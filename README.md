Generating polygenic risk scores in UK Biobank (University of Bristol)

This repository is for generating polygenic risk scores (PRS) in UK Biobank when using Blue Crystal at the university of Bristol. 

The code will likely not work elsewhere due to the intricacies of supercomputers, but by all means give it a go.

There is a help file for the function, and a beginner's guide to using UK Biobank genetic data too.
